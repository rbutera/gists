# Hi, I'm Rai and I <3 Innovation

# Bio
I have been designing and developing websites since 2001… but for many
years it was always a hobby, a side-hustle, a ‘distraction’.

I founded Cloakroom (a nightlife PWA + iOS app) in 2013 after I decided to
stop fighting and start embracing that distraction.

I’ve been hooked on JavaScript and building the next generation of the web
ever since.

In 2016 I decided to go back to university to get a formal qualification…
but I’ve recently decided to suspend my studies indefinitely.

That means I’m ready to channel my energy into creativity and problem
solving again, and truly excited to help build great apps and ultimately
create value for innovative startups.
